        "We clarify your personal situation, budget and location preferences before starting the search. Our aim is to find a property that truly fits your life – in Weinheim, the Bergstraße and the Rhine-Neckar region.",
        "Plan your finances early: equity, running costs, notary and land registry fees, and broker commission. Compare financing options and obtain a financing certificate so you can act quickly when you find the right property.",
        "We continuously monitor the market in Weinheim and the Bergstraße region and will contact you when a property matches your criteria. You receive clear descriptions and can decide in peace whether to view it.",
        "During viewings we check the condition of the property: structure, heating, electrics, moisture, defects and refurbishment needs. We recommend an independent surveyor if needed so you can assess the price and plan realistically.",
        "Before buying, review the land register extract, floor plan, energy certificate, declaration of division (for condominiums) and owners’ meeting minutes. We help you spot discrepancies or encumbrances and understand the rights and obligations attached to the property.",
        "Based on market comparison, condition and your finances we provide a realistic price recommendation. We negotiate with the seller or their agent and aim for fair terms and a transparent, timely conclusion.",
        "The notarial purchase contract is the legally binding step. We prepare the documents with you and can accompany you to the notary. The notary explains the contract, certifies the transfer and initiates the land register entry.",
        "At handover, keys are handed over, meter readings recorded and the condition documented. We coordinate between you and the seller and are available for any questions so that move-in runs smoothly.",
        "We remain your contact after the purchase. For questions on utilities, insurance, tradespeople or future sales, you can turn to us as your long-term partner for property in Weinheim and the Bergstraße."
